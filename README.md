# Colony Coding Challenge

Your task for this challenge is to build a simple events list display. I looks something like this:

![Events List](./events-list-screenshot.png)

The page you'll be creating just displays the list of formatted event data in a _(mostly)_ non-interactive way, sorted in a certain way.

## Stack

We expect this task to be completed using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

For this, we suggest using [`create-react-app`](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), but we won't count it against you if you preffer to set up your enviroment yourself, as long as it meets the above criteria.

The additional external libraries you'll need to complete this will be detailed in the appropriate section(s).

## Design

The design specs provided are orientative, as we won't count the exact pixels, but do try to make them as close as possible _(going by both the below specs and the provided screenshot)_.
