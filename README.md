# Colony Coding Challenge

Your task for this challenge is to build a simple events list display. I looks something like this:

![Events List](./events-list-screenshot.png)

The page you'll be creating just displays the list of formatted event data in a _(mostly)_ non-interactive way, sorted in a certain way.
